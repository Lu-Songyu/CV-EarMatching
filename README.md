<p>This Matlab program is part of the spatial audio demo. This program uses a computer vision toolbox to find the best match for the user's ear in the CIPIC database and provides a subject number, which will be used to customize spatial audio generated in the other part of the program. To find code and set up the audio generator, go to the GitHub Repo below.</p> <hr>
